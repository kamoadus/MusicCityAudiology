            <h2>Hearing loss</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">I only have trouble in group settings and noisy environments. Should I get my hearing checked?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Group settings and noisy places are difficult communication environments. This is a primary complaint for many people. A hearing evaluation is recommended to identify any amount of hearing loss.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can hearing loss lead to cognitive decline?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>This is a complex question and a common concern for many of my patients. There is extensive research correlating hearing loss and cognitive impairment. Even mild hearing loss is a risk factor for cognitive decline. Hearing aids can slow the natural progression of decline with aging. Furthermore, hearing loss leads to social isolation which can contribute to dementia.</p>
            </div>
     
            <h2>Hearing Aids</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">I have hearing loss, but I do not feel like I need hearing aids. Should I wait?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Once hearing loss is identified, it is not going to improve [for many]. In the long run, it is better to treat hearing loss sooner rather than later in order to allow your brain to adjust and get used to the sounds it has been missing.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Will my hearing loss stabilize and/or stop declining once I wear hearing aids?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Every case is different and hearing aids are not meant to stop the actual degeneration of your hearing. I have seen hearing aid users with stable hearing for years and others that need adjustments due to further decline.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">There are so many advertisements and options out there. How do I know what is right for me?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>During an Audiology Consult, I will get to understand your lifestyle and listening environments. There is not a “one size fits all” option. My goal is to prescribe devices that fit your lifestyle and needs.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Why do some people have a hard time adjusting to hearing aids?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>This is another complex question. Hearing aids take time to adjust to - physically and mentally. It takes consistent and continuous use for your brain to adapt to the sound it has been missing out on. It also takes time to develop the new skills associated with manipulating the device and properly inserting it into your ears.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can you service hearing aids that were not prescribed by you?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, I am able to troubleshoot, clean, and help with any devices. I might not have access to some supplies depending on the brand of your devices.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can you program my hearing aids that were not prescribed by you?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>I only work with one manufacturer (Phonak) and do not have access to other programming software at this time.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can you help connect to my phone and television?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, I can assist with any devices that have Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What type of hearing aids do you dispense?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>The style of hearing aid I prescribe will best fit your hearing loss, ear size/shape and lifestyle. I offer custom and over-the-ear styles. Some available features include Bluetooth and rechargeable options.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What brands of hearing aids do you work with?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Major brands include Oticon, Phonak, Resound, Signia, Starkey, and Widex.</p>
            </div>
     
            <h2>Tinnitus</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have tinnitus (e.g. ringing, buzzing, etc.) in my ears/head?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>A great starting point is to schedule an Audiology Consult which includes a hearing test. We will discuss the results and explain potential causes of tinnitus.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">How can I prevent tinnitus and hearing loss?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>There are many factors that can lead to tinnitus and/or hearing loss (genetics, medications, underlying health issues, noise exposure, etc.). Reducing the amount of noise exposure and using hearing protection when exposed to loud sound can assist in reducing the chances of developing tinnitus and/or hearing loss.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Will hearing aids help my tinnitus?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>While some people have tinnitus without identified hearing loss, many individuals with tinnitus also have hearing loss. Treating hearing loss and giving your brain access to the sound it has been missing can help reduce the perception of the noise. Additionally, I can create a tinnitus 'masker' program in the hearing aid settings to assist in the treatment process.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Is there a cure for tinnitus?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Identifying a possible underlying condition is helpful, but there is no “cure” for tinnitus. Learning your triggers and developing coping mechanisms is essential for tinnitus management.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
     
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Music</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can you help me with in-ear monitors?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>I can take earmold impressions for you to send to an in-ear company of your choice. I can also clean your devices for you.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">The foam earplugs make me feel "stopped up." Are there better options?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>I never recommend foam plugs unless that is your only available option. For musicians, stage crew and concert-goers, I offer custom and universal fit plugs specifically designed to block out the loud impulse sounds while still giving you access to the clarity.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What are musician plugs?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>The musician plugs I offer come in custom or universal options. Both styles come with a filter specifically designed for musicians and music lovers. You can still hear clearly, but are better protected from louder impulse sounds.</p>
            </div>
     
            <h2>Insurance</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">Are your services covered by insurance?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Some of the services might be covered, but the majority of services I offer are not typically covered by insurance.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Do you file to insurance?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>I am a Medicare provider and some services call be filed to insurance. Consult your insurance carrier for more information on submitting claims.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What does "Unbundled" mean?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Unbundled services means that you only pay for what you need.</p>
            </div>
     
            <h2>Noise Exposure</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">How loud is too loud?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>In general, you want to limit the amount of time you are exposed to certain loud sounds because that noise can cause temporary or even permanent hearing loss. Noise exposure follows a time-intensity trade-off (see the next question).</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What is the time-intensity trade-off?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has calculated the Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) as 85 decibels as an 8-hr time weighted average (TWA). With every 3 decibel increase, the exposure time should be cut in half.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">NIOSH Noise Chart</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Check out this link <a href="https://www.nonoise.org/hearing/criteria/criteria.htm">Occupational Noise Exposure</a> or email me for a copy of the Time-Intensity trade-off chart.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">How can I protect my ears?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>The world is a loud and noisy place. There are many environments and recreational activities that are harmful to your ears. There are also some sounds that are simply bothersome. Some examples include construction and factory sites, motorsports, hunting, traveling (airplanes), and sleeping (snoring). I can fit you with earplugs for any environment.</p>
            </div>
     
            <h2>Earwax</h2>
     
            <button class="accordion">What is the best way to remove earwax?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Most people cannot remove earwax successfully on their own. I have tools to assist with visualizing the wax build-up and identifying important anatomical structures in the ear canal leading up to the eardrum.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">What do you use to remove earwax?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>There are three primary methods for removal. Irrigation (water), suction, and mechanical (lighted curette). Understanding the age, amount, and depth of the wax is important in successful removal.</p>
            </div>
     
            <button class="accordion">Can I use a solution to remove the wax?</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Solutions such as hydrogen-peroxide and other cerumenolytics are helpful in breaking wax off of the ear canal walls to better assist with the removal.</p>
